        Cluster State Provider that stores state in Redis. This can be used as an alternative to the ZooKeeper State Provider.

        This provider requires the following properties:

            Redis Mode - The type of Redis instance:
                            - Standalone
                            - Sentinel
                            - Cluster (currently not supported for state-management due to use of WATCH command which Redis does not support in clustered mode)

            Connection String - The connection string for Redis.
                        - In a standalone instance this value will be of the form hostname:port.
                        - In a sentinel instance this value will be the comma-separated list of sentinels, such as host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3.
                        - In a clustered instance this value will be the comma-separated list of cluster masters, such as host1:port,host2:port,host3:port.

        This provider has the following optional properties:

            Key Prefix - The prefix for each key stored by this state provider. When sharing a single Redis across multiple NiFi instances, setting a unique
                        value for the Key Prefix will make it easier to identify which instances the keys came from (default nifi/components/).

            Database Index - The database index to be used by connections created from this connection pool.
                        See the databases property in redis.conf, by default databases 0-15 will be available.

            Communication Timeout - The timeout to use when attempting to communicate with Redis.

            Cluster Max Redirects - The maximum number of redirects that can be performed when clustered.

            Sentinel Master - The name of the sentinel master, require when Mode is set to Sentinel.

            Password - The password used to authenticate to the Redis server. See the requirepass property in redis.conf.

            Pool - Max Total - The maximum number of connections that can be allocated by the pool (checked out to clients, or idle awaiting checkout).
                        A negative value indicates that there is no limit.

            Pool - Max Idle - The maximum number of idle connections that can be held in the pool, or a negative value if there is no limit.

            Pool - Min Idle - The target for the minimum number of idle connections to maintain in the pool. If the configured value of Min Idle is
                    greater than the configured value for Max Idle, then the value of Max Idle will be used instead.

            Pool - Block When Exhausted - Whether or not clients should block and wait when trying to obtain a connection from the pool when the pool
                    has no available connections. Setting this to false means an error will occur immediately when a client requests a connection and
                    none are available.

            Pool - Max Wait Time - The amount of time to wait for an available connection when Block When Exhausted is set to true.

            Pool - Min Evictable Idle Time - The minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction.

            Pool - Time Between Eviction Runs - The amount of time between attempting to evict idle connections from the pool.

            Pool - Num Tests Per Eviction Run - The number of connections to tests per eviction attempt. A negative value indicates to test all connections.

            Pool - Test On Create - Whether or not connections should be tested upon creation (default false).

            Pool - Test On Borrow - Whether or not connections should be tested upon borrowing from the pool (default false).

            Pool - Test On Return - Whether or not connections should be tested upon returning to the pool (default false).

            Pool - Test While Idle - Whether or not connections should be tested while idle (default true).
